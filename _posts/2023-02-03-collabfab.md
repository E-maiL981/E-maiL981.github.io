## Overview

At Worcester Polytechnic Institute's Collablab, we have an incomplete INTAMSYS FUNMAT Pro 3D printer that has been dormant for around three years. Originally, this printer had a value of 22,000 dollars, with a build volume of 450 x 450 x 600 mm, and capapble of prinitng materials like nylon and polycarbonate. It now sits idle due to missing essential components and software. Despite its current condition, I see a significant opportunity to bring it back to operational status and enhance our lab's capabilities.

## Problem

The current state of the printer is quite far from being functional; it lacks an extruder, motors, and the necessary software to get it running. Moreover, its control system is based on custom, proprietary parts, making the path to restoration a bit more complex. It has remained a substantial, non-operational occupant in our lab, consuming space that could potentially be utilized more efficiently. An attempt to secure funds for the required parts met with a refusal from the student government in the spring of 2023, adding to the delay in reviving this asset.
## Solution

Despite the hurdles encountered so far, there is a renewed determination to get this project off the ground. The road to refurbishment includes rebuilding nearly the entire printer, barring its existing structure. While obtaining every part from a wishlist is off the cards due to budget constraints, the primary goal remains to have it operational, albeit with necessary compromises. The eventual aspiration is to foster a more enhanced functioning by reworking the gantry system for better print area access and contemplating a transition to a corexy system in the later stages.
## What I Learned

Embarking on this endeavor has been a learning process, understanding the depth of work involved in reviving a complex piece of equipment. It's a hands-on lesson in persistence and resourcefulness, pushing ahead with available resources while keeping the vision intact. The process has been a real eye-opener, offering a practical lesson in tackling hurdles with a problem-solving mindset while eyeing the potential transformative impact this could have on our lab's functionality. 

I've enjoyed the opportunity to work on a real world project, running into each little problem and solving them along the way. It's a work in progress, a step-by-step journey towards transforming a dormant asset into a functional powerhouse.
