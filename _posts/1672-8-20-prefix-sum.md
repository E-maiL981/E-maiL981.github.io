As part of the project, the multithreaded code was benchmarked against a serial version of the prefix sum, with our grade dependent on how fast we could make it. 

During the project, I got pretty interested in the process of optimization. I started asking myself 


### Quick Aside
If you're just here because you're interested in making programs go zoom, I can r
