I'm Liam Jennings, welcome to my portfolio site. I'm a software engineer student from Seattle. I'm currently working on a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and a Master's in Robotics Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

I've always enjoyed problem solving, and software engineering was a natural extension to that. After trying it, I started learning robotics so I could solve physical problems. Since then, I've delved into robotic controls and deep learning through classes at my college. I also dabble a bit with cyber security.

I love to read in my spare time, and hate myself while hiking. Cooking is fun too!

I recently interned at STR, where I worked on a cyber security project involving .NET programs. 

My primary goal is to build cool robots with the intelligence and dexterity required to solve real world problems. I'd really like it if these robots were in space.
