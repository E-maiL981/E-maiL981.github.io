This the github repo for my portfolio website. It is based on the [alembic](https://alembic.darn.es/) github theme. Additionally, I used code from fireship.io's [css grid](https://fireship.io/lessons/three-responsive-css-grid-layouts/) article to create the gallery for my projects.

The reason there are so many commits is that I couldn't manage to get jekyll running locally on my ubuntu machine, so I had to make a new commit every time I wanted to see changes.
